## An example project with Gulp using Bourbon and Neat

[Bourbon] is a library of [Sass] mixins and functions that are designed to make
you a more efficient style sheet author.

[Neat] is a fluid grid framework with the aim of being easy enough to
use out of the box and flexible enough to customize down the road.
